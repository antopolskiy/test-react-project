 # Task
 
 Create a functional React component that contains four textareas and a submit button. 
 
 Upon clicking the submit button, the content from the textareas should be displayed as a list below them. Every time the form is reset and new data is submitted, it should appear as a new list item under the previous one. Finally, you need to style the component using a separate CSS file with appropriate padding, margins, and display properties.
